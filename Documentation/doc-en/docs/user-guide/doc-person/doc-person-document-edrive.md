It is possible in the 5.0 d'Ecclesia**CRM** and higher, to manage the files with a file manager 

EDrive has a public and a private part, which are two different files and which: 

- allows a clair link in the public part ( for MailChimp, for documents and images, files and to share a file to a person who is not a CRM user) 

- in other cases the files have an url which will only be valid during the connection
